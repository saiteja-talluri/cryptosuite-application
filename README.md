# CryptoSuite

> This project implements a small cryptosuite application to demonstrate modular operations (addition,multiplication and exponentiation),GCD, Inverse Modulo, Discrete logarithm (using either Pohlig-Hellman, index calculus, Pollard-rho or the basic Baby Step Giant Step algorithm), RSA cryptosystem and Field Operations in Prime Fields and Binary Fields using the biginteger class in C++.

It was made as the final project for CS 101 - **Computer Programming and Utilisation** course in Autumn 2016 at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
